# game-of-life

> The Game of Life from John Conway implemented with Vue.js

This project is a coding challenge that i made to test my skill on Vue 2 and some basic configuration with Nuxt and Bulma.

I started this project after watching the Vue Mastery courses and [Chris Fritz video on Visualizations using SVG, Canvas, and WebGL in Vue](https://youtu.be/a2jhqi3_Cdg?t=46).

## Documentation

The directory structure of this project was generated by [Nuxt 2](https://nuxtjs.org) with [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) for the UI framework.
